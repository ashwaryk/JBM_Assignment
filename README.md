# JBM_Assignment

The data that was given is very limited. Very less samples were present for training a Neural Network.
"Image Augmentation" was used to generate more samples from the existing given samples.
A seperate code file is attached in the repository with the name "Image Augmentation.ipynb".

Checkpoint file and .pb files are generated that can be used to integrate with the Android mobile app.
